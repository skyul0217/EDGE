He's been really single', yeah.
The day Hye-Jin got so upset.
She's always there without you.
Baby, say the words and I'm down
All I need is you on my side
It hurts when you can't forget her.

He's just playingin'.
Boys will always be sadin', yeah
The day Hye-Jin got so upset.
She's always there without you.
Baby, say the words and I'm down
All I need is you on my side
I'll be there right now, lost the boy on your arm.
